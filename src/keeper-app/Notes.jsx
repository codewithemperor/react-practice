      content: "Today's recipe is for a delicious and hearty chicken pot pie. Begin by preheating your oven to 375°F. In a large pot, cook diced chicken breasts until browned. Remove the chicken and sauté onions, carrots, and peas in the same pot. Add flour to the vegetables and stir until coated, then gradually pour in chicken broth and milk to create a creamy sauce. Return the chicken to the pot, mix well, and season with salt, pepper, and thyme. Transfer the mixture to a pie crust, cover with a second crust, and bake for 45 minutes or until golden brown."
